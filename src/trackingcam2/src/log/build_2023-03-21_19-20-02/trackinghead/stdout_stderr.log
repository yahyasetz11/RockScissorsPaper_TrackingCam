CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:23 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findimage_transport.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "image_transport", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "image_transport"
  with any of the following names:

    image_transportConfig.cmake
    image_transport-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "image_transport" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or
  set "image_transport_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.
  If "image_transport" provides a separate development package or SDK, be
  sure it has been installed.

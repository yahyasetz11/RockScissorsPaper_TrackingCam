[2.296s] CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:23 (find_package):
[2.296s]   By not providing "Findimage_transport.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
[2.296s]   project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
[2.296s]   "image_transport", but CMake did not find one.
[2.296s] 
[2.297s]   Could not find a package configuration file provided by "image_transport"
[2.297s]   with any of the following names:
[2.297s] 
[2.297s]     image_transportConfig.cmake
[2.297s]     image_transport-config.cmake
[2.297s] 
[2.297s]   Add the installation prefix of "image_transport" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or
[2.297s]   set "image_transport_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.
[2.297s]   If "image_transport" provides a separate development package or SDK, be
[2.297s]   sure it has been installed.
